# In many states, almost all states convicted felons are banned from voting while they serve their prison, parole,
# or probation sentence. In some of those states, they are able to have their voting rights restored. 
# Even after voting rights are restored, former felons continue to register to vote and vote at extremely low rates. 
# In this question, we will look at an experiment (co-authored by UPenn’s Dr. Marc Meredith) that sought to understand 
# what caused these low rates. The researchers were specifically interested in how much of this low rate could be 
# explained by felons’ not knowing that their voting rights had been or could be restored after serving their sentence.

# For these exercises, you will use the dataset ‘felons.RData’ to replicate some of the findings in the article 
# “Can Incarcerated Felons be (Re)integrated into the Political System? Results from a Field Experiment.”

# a. Imagine you wanted to understand the effect that felony convictions and incarceration have on voter 
# registration and turnout (after the sentence has been served). 
# Somebody suggests that you compare the voter registration rates and turnout rates of former felons to people 
# who never have served time for a felony. Discuss why this research design could or could not help you to get a 
# good estimate of the causal effect that you are interested in.

# This design could be productive  as long as we have more data to work from, as the presented premise relies on
# dependent variables that are technically very different contextually and are arguably mutually exclusive. In other words, 
# though there may be correlation, the fact that we don't know how one might directly influence the other would likely 
# lead to data that is skewed against ex-felons' participation for an array of un-addressed reasons. We need a third element 
# that accounts for outlaying factors and distinctly ties these variables together. An example could be something 
# like whether the non-felons served time at all (since even 6 months in jail for non-felonies can impact 
# civic participation) for something else, or whether the felon went to prison more than once 
# (since 1 felony bout vs 3 will impact civic participation).

#b. Read the Experimental Design section of the “Can Incarcerated Felons be (Re)integrated into the Political System?” 
# (pages 915 through 917 in gerber, et al 2015.pdf ).

#i. What are the causal effect(s) that the authors are interested in studying? 

# The authors want to study the causal impact of felony time served on an individual's likeliness to vote 
# compared against on their level of education on their ability to exercise their political engagement rights.

# ii. Describe the treatment and control conditions in the experiment.

# The control group was a group of ex-felons whose data was provided by the state of CT that would not be contacted 
# to inform of their right to engage in the voting process. The treatment group was another group of CT-based
# ex-felons that would be engaged via marketing campaign and educated on their voting rights. This group was also 
# parsed down to consider the nature of the crimes committed, and to account for the 40% outreach that bounce. 
# CT was chosen because it is a state that re-instates a felon's voting rights upon release.

#The findings here also took further a multi-state study that tested a similar hypothesis (minus outreach) in 2008.

#iii. Describe the randomization strategy that the authors used.

# For the treatment group, a randomly selected subset of ex-felons were sent letters at random (one of two types) on 
# Secretary of State letterhead informing them that they were currently not registered to vote but were eligible to do so.
# This group was then split into two groups, where any imbalances in demographics, release date, and crimes committed 
# were balanced, and where one treatment group's letter merely stated an eligibility to vote while the other group
# was offered an explanation of their voting rights from a certified letter from the Secretary of State.

# c. Now we’re going to analyze the results from the experiment. Begin by removing the 161 people in the dataset 
# who returned to prison before the experiment was conducted. Then create a new variable called ‘treatment_collapsed’ 
# which tells us whether each observation in the data was in the control group (FALSE) or a treatment group (TRUE).

load("~/Documents/Education/Penn/Classes/DATA 210/Week 7/felons.RData")

count(felons, returntoprison == 1) # Confirming that 161 subjects have returned to prison

felons.exp <- subset(felons, felons$returntoprison == 0) # Creating new set with 161 excluded

count(felons.exp, returntoprison == 1) # Validating prev line

attributes(felons$treatment) # Getting better data for the treatment column

felons.exp <- mutate(felons.exp,
       treatment_collapsed = treatment != 1) # Adding new variable based on control group logic

felons.exp <- select(felons.exp, -returntoprison) # Removing "returntoprison" since none in this group went back

# d. The first thing you should always do before analyzing the results of an experiment is assess whether you have 
# balance in your treatment and control groups. In a well-balanced experiment, no pre-treatment covariates 
# (i.e. the variables that existed before you ran the experiment) would predict whether or not somebody ended up 
# in the treatment or control group. For the following questions, use the treatment_collapsed variable.

# i. Use 4 t-tests to assess whether the felons’ age, number of days served in prison, time since their release 
# from prison, or 2008 vote turnout is a statistically significant predictor of treatment. To do the t-tests, 
# you’ll want to write code that looks like this: t.test(felons$age ~ felons$treatment_collapsed). 
# Create a well-formatted table the present the average values for each of these variables in the treatment 
# and control groups, as well as the the p-value associated with the difference between those averages. 
# You can pull out these values from the output of the t.test() object using the $ operator. 
# Is there significant imbalance for any of those four variables?

age.exp <- t.test(felons.exp$age ~ felons.exp$treatment_collapsed) # Getting analysis for each
num.days.served.exp <- t.test(felons.exp$days_served ~ felons.exp$treatment_collapsed)
yrs.since.release.exp <- t.test(felons.exp$yrs_since_release ~ felons.exp$treatment_collapsed)
vote08.exp <- t.test(felons.exp$vote08 ~ felons.exp$treatment_collapsed)

# Validating t-tests

mean(felons.exp$age[felons.exp$treatment_collapsed == TRUE]) # 35.23
mean(felons.exp$age[felons.exp$treatment_collapsed == FALSE]) # 35.34

mean(felons.exp$days_served[felons.exp$treatment_collapsed == TRUE]) # 369.48
mean(felons.exp$days_served[felons.exp$treatment_collapsed == FALSE]) # 370.13

mean(felons.exp$yrs_since_release[felons.exp$treatment_collapsed == TRUE]) # 1.8
mean(felons.exp$yrs_since_release[felons.exp$treatment_collapsed == FALSE]) # 1.8

mean(felons.exp$vote08[felons.exp$treatment_collapsed == TRUE], na.rm = TRUE) # .0522
mean(felons.exp$vote08[felons.exp$treatment_collapsed == FALSE], na.rm =  TRUE) # .0495

library(broom) # Organizing into a table
library(purrr)

testgroup <- map_df(list(age.exp, num.days.served.exp, vote08.exp, yrs.since.release.exp), tidy)

testgroup <- rename(testgroup,
                    mean.diff = estimate,
                    control = mean.false,
                    treatment = mean.true) # Renaming columns for easier navigation

rownames(testgroup) <- c("age", "num.days.served", "vote08", "time.since.release") # Identifying each row better as well

# According to my table, there aren't any major imbalances.

# ii. Use linear regression to assess whether the type of crime predicts whether somebody ended up in the treatment or control group. 
# Were any crimes strong predictors of the treatment?

# Analyzing whether treatment group is influenced by felony type

summary(lm(treatment_collapsed ~ felony_type, data = felons.exp))

# According to this analysis, no particular felony type influenced whether or not they were in a particular group.

# iii. Use linear regression to assess balance for all the variables (age, days in prison, time since release, 2008 turnout,
# crime type) simultaneously. When you do this, do you find imbalance for any of the pre-treatment covariates?

summary(lm(treatment_collapsed ~ 
             vote08 + 
             age + 
             days_served + 
             yrs_since_release + 
             felony_type, 
           data = felons.exp))

# No imbalances found.

# e. Did the experiment have an effect on whether or not ex-felons registered to vote? Did it impact their turnout in 2012? 
# If so, how much did the treatment increase or decrease the probability that they registered or turned out? 
# You can use linear regression and the ‘treatment_collapsed’ variable to answer this question.

summary(lm(treatment_collapsed ~ registered, data = felons.exp))

# There is strong indication that registration numbers were impacted by the experiment, as 
# the p-value of .0047 demonstrates a significant difference between the control and treatment groups.

summary(lm(treatment_collapsed ~ vote12, data = felons.exp))

# Though less impacted (p-value of .048 or < .05), the experiment did make a significant difference on 2012 turnout.

summary(lm(treatment_collapsed ~ registered + vote12, data = felons.exp))

# f. Use linear regression to estimate these two treatment effects again. This time, control for the five pre-treatment 
# covariates (the ones you checked for balance in part C in your regression). What effect did the treatment have 
# on registration and voting?

# Regressions with pre-treatments included to get registration data:

summary(lm(treatment_collapsed ~ felony_type + treatment + age + days_served + yrs_since_release,
           data = felons.exp[felons.exp$registered == 1,]))

summary(lm(treatment_collapsed ~ felony_type + treatment + age + days_served + yrs_since_release,
           data = felons.exp[felons.exp$registered == 0,]))

# Regressions with pre-treatments included to get 2012 voter data:

summary(lm(treatment_collapsed ~ felony_type + treatment + age + days_served + yrs_since_release,
           data = felons.exp[felons.exp$vote12 == 1,]))

summary(lm(treatment_collapsed ~ felony_type + treatment + age + days_served + yrs_since_release,
           data = felons.exp[felons.exp$vote12 == 0,]))

# The data, even once weighted by pre-treatment controls, demonstrates a significant increase in 
# voter registration and turnout for those included in the treatment group.
