# Summary of Projects
This repo contains projects from my second Data Analytics courses, designed to demonstrate marked improvements and a broader grasp of key topics through more complex problem sets.

## Project Summaries

### Project 1: Analysis of Voting Rights Restoration for Former Felons

**Focus:**
- Investigated the impact of felony convictions and incarceration on voter registration and turnout.
- Evaluated the effect of informing former felons about restored voting rights on their likelihood to participate in elections.

**Skills and Techniques:**
- Data manipulation and cleaning with `R` (e.g., subsetting data, creating new variables).
- Statistical analysis (t-tests, linear regression) to assess treatment effects and balance between groups.
- Understanding experimental design, including treatment and control conditions and randomization.

**Key Takeaways:**
- Demonstrated how targeted interventions can influence voter participation among specific populations.
- Emphasized the importance of experimental design and statistical testing in drawing causal conclusions.

### Project 2: Population Density and Revenue Analysis

**Focus:**
- Analyzed the relationship between state population density and total revenue across the United States.
- Investigated correlations and trends using economic and demographic data.

**Skills and Techniques:**
- Data wrangling and merging (e.g., combining datasets, calculating new variables).
- Aggregation of data to summarize state-level revenue.
- Data visualization using `ggplot2` to explore and present relationships between variables.

**Key Takeaways:**
- Explored the complex relationship between population density and revenue, highlighting the influence of sector-specific factors.
- Gained experience in handling and visualizing large datasets to communicate insights effectively.

### Project 3: Survey Data Analysis on Political Attitudes

**Focus:**
- Analyzed survey data to examine political attitudes, including voter preferences and feelings towards the federal government.
- Compared attitudes between different political affiliations.

**Skills and Techniques:**
- Data cleaning and subsetting (e.g., filtering survey responses, creating new variables).
- Calculation of descriptive statistics and differences in means.
- Regression analysis to explore relationships between political attitudes and survey responses.

**Key Takeaways:**
- Provided insights into how political affiliation influences attitudes towards government.
- Developed skills in cleaning, analyzing, and interpreting survey data to understand public opinion.

### Project 4: Analysis of State and Federal Election Data

**Focus:**
- Investigated the impact of electoral conditions and voter registration data on election outcomes.
- Analyzed how various factors, such as eligibility information, affect voter turnout and registration rates.

**Skills and Techniques:**
- Applied data manipulation and analysis to election data using `R`.
- Conducted regression analyses to understand the effects of different variables on election outcomes.
- Interpreted statistical results to evaluate the effectiveness of electoral interventions.

**Key Takeaways:**
- Demonstrated ability to analyze complex election data and assess the impact of interventions on voter behavior.
- Highlighted the importance of understanding voter eligibility and registration in electoral studies.
